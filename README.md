# Forecasting apartment prices using Prophet

As I moved to another state and was looking for a new apartment to rent, I started wondering: can I use Machine Learning to find seasonality patterns? Are months where rent is cheaper so I can save money before leasing an apartment?

In this project, I use Facebook Prophet, a procedure for forecasting time series data and find seasonality patterns. The results indicate that one could save up to $1000 per year on apartment rental prices by selecting the optimal time of the year to sign the apartment lease.

### Data Source
- [Apartment List data](https://www.apartmentlist.com/research/category/data-rent-estimates)

### Time Series Forecasting
It's a supervised learning model where you have input variables (X) and an output variable (y) and you use an algorithm to learn the mapping function from the input to the output.
- *__x__* variable &rightarrow; _datetime_
- *__y__* variable &rightarrow; _price_
